export const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Is varicose vein treatment covered by health insurance and Medicare?",
    answer: "Yes, in the vast majority of cases where patients experience symptoms (pain, swelling, heaviness, skin discoloration, or ulcers) and duplex ultrasound confirms pathological reflux (>0.5 seconds), treatments like EVLA, RFA, and microphlebectomy are deemed medically necessary and covered. Spider vein treatment performed purely for cosmetic reasons is typically self-pay."
  },
  {
    question: "What actually happens to the blood flow when a diseased vein is closed?",
    answer: "Diseased varicose veins are already dysfunctional; rather than carrying blood upward, they allow blood to pool backward. Once the faulty vein is sealed, your body naturally reroutes circulation into the dozens of healthy, competent deep and superficial veins in the leg, immediately improving overall circulatory efficiency."
  },
  {
    question: "How does duplex ultrasound diagnose varicose veins?",
    answer: "Duplex ultrasound combines conventional B-mode anatomical imaging with Color Flow Doppler and Spectral waveform analysis. While you stand upright, the sonographer places a warm gel probe along your leg and gently squeezes your calf. If blood rushes backwards toward your feet for more than 0.5 seconds upon release, valve incompetence is confirmed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can varicose veins come back after endovenous laser or glue treatment?",
    answer: "The specific vein segment that has been closed by laser, radiofrequency, or VenaSeal cannot reopen or become varicose again (it is absorbed by the body over time). However, because chronic venous insufficiency is a progressive condition, untreated adjacent veins may develop valve weakness years later. Regular low-impact exercise and weight maintenance help protect other veins."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a Phlebologist and a Vascular Surgeon?",
    answer: "A Phlebologist is a physician who has specialized certification and dedicated clinical training in diagnosing and treating vein disorders. A Vascular Surgeon is a surgeon trained in all aspects of arterial and venous surgery. Both specialists perform modern minimally invasive endovenous ablations, duplex ultrasounds, and sclerotherapy in clinic settings."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to take days off work after modern vein procedures?",
    answer: "Most patients walk out of the clinic unassisted immediately after treatment and return to sedentary or light desk work the very next morning. Strenuous high-impact workouts, heavy squats, and hot tubs are typically avoided for 7 to 10 days."
